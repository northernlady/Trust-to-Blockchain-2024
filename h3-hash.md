- One-way functions are easy to compute in one direction but very difficult to reverse, like breaking a plate into pieces. Trapdoor one-way functions are also hard to reverse, but have a secret "trapdoor" that allows the function to be computed easily in the other direction.

- One-way hash functions are a fundamental cryptographic tool that take variable-length inputs and produce a fixed-length "fingerprint" or hash value. These functions are designed to be easy to compute in one direction but computationally infeasible to reverse. Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are a type of one-way hash that also incorporates a secret key, allowing only the holder of the key to verify the hash.

###### Reference: Karvinen 2022, [Cracking Passwords with Hashcat](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/)

This tutorial explains how to use Hashcat to crack password hashes. It demonstrates how password cracking works: since systems store passwords as hashes, Hashcat attempts to match a hash by converting dictionary words into hashes until it finds a match. The tutorial covers installing Hashcat, identifying hash types, using the RockYou dictionary, and successfully cracking the hash for the word 'summer'.

#### a) 

Iâ€™ll approach this systematically by testing different strings to find one that produces a hash starting with zero.

 I found that adding "M6" to "hello" creates a hash starting with zero.

<br/>

The main observation is that even changing just one symbol (. to !) results in a completely different hash value.

#### e)  How can you make a password that's protected against a dictionary attack?
- Use a long, random passphrase with a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts
- Use a password manager
